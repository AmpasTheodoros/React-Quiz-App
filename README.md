# React Quiz App

This repository contains a quiz app built using React. The app allows users to take a quiz with multiple choice questions and view their score at the end.

## Getting Started

To use the app, clone or download the repository and run `npm install` and `npm start` to start the development server. The app can be accessed at `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Features

- The app includes a list of multiple choice questions with four possible answers.
- The app allows users to select an answer for each question and submit their answers at the end.
- The app calculates the user's score based on their correct answers and displays their score at the end.
- The app includes a reset button to start a new quiz.

## Future Plans

In the future, I plan to add additional features to the app such as:

- The ability for users to save and load their quiz progress.
- The ability to customize the appearance of the app, including the color and font.
- The ability to add different question types, such as fill-in-the-blank and matching.

## Credits

This project was created by [AmpasTheodoros](https://github.com/AmpasTheodoros) as a way to learn and practice React Hooks, components, props, useState(). The quiz questions and answers were sourced from [OpenTriviaDB](https://opentdb.com/).
